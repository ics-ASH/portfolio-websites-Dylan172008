<h3>Computer Hardware - Hard Drive</h3>
A hard disk drive, hard disk, or hard drive, is an electro-mechanical data storage device that stores and retrieves digital data using magnetic storage with one or more rigid fast rotating platters coated with magnetic material. The platters are paired with magnetic heads, usually arranged on a moving actuator arm, which read and write data to the platter surface. Data is accessed in a random-access manner, meaning that individual blocks of data can be stored and retrieved in any order. HDDs are a type of non-volatile storage, retaining stored data when powered off. Modern HDDs are typically in the form of a small rectangular box. another type of harddrive is an SSD which stands for solid state drive. A solid state drive uses integrated circuits to store data instead of the slow disks that a HDD uses.
