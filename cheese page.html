<h3>Computer Hardware - Hard Drive</h3>
A hard disk drive, hard disk, or hard drive, is an electro-mechanical data storage device that stores and retrieves digital data using magnetic storage with one or more rigid fast rotating platters coated with magnetic material. The platters are paired with magnetic heads, usually arranged on a moving actuator arm, which read and write data to the platter surface. Data is accessed in a random-access manner, meaning that individual blocks of data can be stored and retrieved in any order. HDDs are a type of non-volatile storage, retaining stored data when powered off. Modern HDDs are typically in the form of a small rectangular box. another type of harddrive is an SSD which stands for solid state drive. A solid state drive uses integrated circuits to store data instead of the slow disks that a HDD uses.

        AI - Self-awareness

Artificial consciousness, also known as machine consciousness, synthetic consciousness or digital If it were suspected that a particular machine was conscious, its rights would be an ethical issue that would need to be assessed consciousness, is the consciousness hypothesized to be possible in artificial intelligence. In 2022, Google engineer Blake Lemoine made a viral claim that Google's LaMDA chatbot was sentient. Lemoine supplied as evidence the chatbot's humanlike answers to many of his questions; however, the chatbot's behavior was judged by the scientific community as likely a consequence of mimicry, rather than machine sentience. Learning is also considered necessary for artificial consciousness. AI - Machine Learning 

AI - machine learning

Machine learning is when a machine or a crude version of AI, can find a solution to a problem through trial and error until the solution is found. There are several kinds of machine learning. analyzes a stream of data and finds patterns and makes predictions without any other guidance. Supervised learning requires a human to label the input data first, and comes in two main varieties: classification (where the program must learn to predict what category the input belongs in) and regression (where the program must deduce a numeric function based on numeric input).

AI-Social intelligence
Affective computing is an interdisciplinary umbrella that comprises systems that recognize, interpret, process or simulate human feeling, emotion and mood.For example, some virtual assistants are programmed to speak conversationally or even to banter humorously; it makes them appear more sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction, or to otherwise facilitate human-computer interaction.
However, this tends to give na√Øve users an unrealistic conception of the intelligence of existing computer agents. Moderate successes related to affective computing include textual sentiment analysis and, more recently,multimodal sentiment analysis, wherein AI classifies the effects displayed by a videotaped subject.
