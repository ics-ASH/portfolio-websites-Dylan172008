    this picture is of kayaking on the gatineau river, i work as a white water kayak instructor during the summer months and i work in the kitchen during winter, i enjoy paddling down class 4 to 5 rapids in my kayak and i dont like to swim out of my kayak because i like to stay dry and i like not having to be rescued because i enjoy rescueing others
